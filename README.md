# Eidos — Visual Mind-Mapping Tool

Eidos is a mobile-first application designed to help users organize ideas through an interactive mind-mapping canvas. The app provides a simple way to capture thoughts as nodes, connect related concepts, and restructure ideas through direct manipulation. It focuses on clarity, smooth interaction, and a distraction-free workspace that encourages visual thinking.

## Overview

Eidos allows users to build mind maps by creating nodes, grouping related items, and defining connections between them. Each node can be freely dragged across the canvas, rearranged, or grouped with others to form structured clusters. Connections update dynamically as the user moves items around, giving a clear view of relationships within the map.

The app stores mind-map data locally using Hive, ensuring that users can reopen and continue their work without relying on a network connection. The interface is optimized for mobile devices, keeping the experience responsive and intuitive.

## Core Features

- Interactive canvas for placing, moving, and organizing nodes.

- Draggable nodes with smooth repositioning and automatic connection updates.

- Node groups for clustering related ideas under a shared label or theme.

- Bidirectional connections that visually represent relationships.

- Local persistence using Hive, allowing maps to be saved and restored.

- Clean mobile-friendly layout, designed for small screens and touch input.

## Purpose

The project demonstrates the development of a structured, interactive Flutter application with a focus on state management, persistent storage, and custom gesture-driven UI components. It showcases the use of Riverpod for state handling, Hive for offline data, and a canvas-based interface for dynamic visual elements.
